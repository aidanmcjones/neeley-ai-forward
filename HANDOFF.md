# Handoff

Update this every hour and at the end of every task.

**Last updated:** Fri Oct 16, scaffold commit

## What works
- agent/llm.py: Claude Opus 5.5 call with cache and refusal fallback
- app/main.py: Streamlit page that loads data/ files, asks a question, shows the answer

## What's broken or untested
- Nothing deployed yet. No case data yet.

## Next 3 tasks
1. Copy the pharma case files into data/ and docs/ when they drop Saturday 9 am
2. Write PLAN.md one-liner, persona, golden path
3. Wire one case input through one prompt into one rendered output

## How to run
```
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # paste the API key
python -m agent.llm    # should print: scaffold OK
streamlit run app/main.py
```
